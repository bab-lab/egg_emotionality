# Introduction

**Physiology of Emotional Reactivity**

It is no surprise that often people experience strong emotional responses in their bodies. However, physical symptoms, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, have scarcely been studied as a measure of emotional arousal. This study will explore the relationship between physical and emotional symptoms and health. In addition, we will explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical and emotional health.
