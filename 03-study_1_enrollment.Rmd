## Enrollment

### Sign Ups

All participants (even those on SONA) are instructed to sign-up via our website which includes filling out a form that submits an email to the BABLab Gmail account.

2. Compose an email from the "email_replies" template in BABLAB/Studies/Inside_Out/Private/Recruitment/email_replies.md (open this with TextEdit)

There are several current templates in here at all times to copy to an email. Copy and replace any brackets with the relevant information.

**Important**

Press reply and delete the two emails in the to field. Replace it with the correct email from the form.

**Participants do not always use the correct email form on the website, and instead just sign up via SONA**

Therefore, we must cross-reference our SONA sign-ups with our ID spreadsheet.

1. Log into [SONA](https://ucla.sona-systems.com/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f)
2. Click "My Studies" and "Timeslots"
3. Click into your timeslot and cross reference the sign-ups with the ID spreadsheet

Add anyone who isn't there and enroll them using the same procedure as above - make sure to insert the correct subject line into the email.

### Tracking

1. Mark the participant status on the ID spreadsheet as completed (green), in progress (yellow), not started (red), or duplicate/cancelled/mistake (dark red and strikethrough)
2. Send the participant 3 reminders (spread out across three days)

The reminder templates can be found in the email_replies.md

**Important** 

Each time you send a participant a reminder, you will need to ensure that their survey code and return code are correct. They can change each time a participant attempts to log in to the survey - so it is imperative to check before sending each reminder. 

Participants will always have a survey code, which can be found by clicking survey options. You must click into the most recently completed survey when sending a reminder (check the timestamp to be sure they are not mid-completion)

Some participants will also have a return code (yellow button) if they saved their place. Remember to send this code to them as well.

4. Fill in age, sex, and recontact permission

### Granting Credit

1. Once participants have completed the survey - log on and grant credit via SONA
